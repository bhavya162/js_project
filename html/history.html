    <h1>HISTORY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
    <img src="Alan-Turing.webp" alt="picture" />
    <p>
      history of artificial intelligence (AI), a survey of important events and
      people in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) from the early work of
      British logician Alan Turing in the 1930s to advancements at the turn of
      the 21st century. AI is the ability of a digital computer or
      computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with
      intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of
      developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic
      of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or
      learn from past experience. For modern developments in AI, see artificial
      intelligence.

    <h2>1940s–1950s: The Birth of AI</h2>
    <p>1943 – First concept of a neural network by McCulloch and Pitts.
1950 – Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test to measure machine intelligence.
1956 – The term “Artificial Intelligence” is officially coined by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference, considered the birth of AI as a field.</p>
   
  <h2> 1950s–1970s: Early Growth & Optimism</h2>
  <p>Development of early AI programs that could solve puzzles and play games like chess.ELIZA (1966) – One of the first chatbot programs.
Researchers believed human-level AI was near, leading to high expectations.</P>

  <h2> 1970s–1980s: The First AI Winter</h2>
  <p>Progress slowed due to limited computing power, and AI couldn’t meet the hype.
Funding and interest dropped—this period is known as the AI Winter.</P>

<h2> 1980s: Expert Systems & Revival</h2>
<p>AI regained popularity with Expert Systems (e.g., MYCIN), which used rule-based logic to mimic human experts.
Still, limitations in handling uncertainty led to a second AI winter in the late 1980s.</p>

<h2> 1990s–2000s: Machine Learning Era</h2>
<p>AI shifted focus to statistical methods and data-driven learning.
1997 – IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
Rise of support vector machines and Bayesian networks.</p>

<h2> 2010s–Present: Deep Learning & Modern AI</h2>
<p>Massive data and GPU-powered computing enabled deep learning (neural networks with many layers).
2012 – Breakthrough in image recognition using deep learning by AlexNet.
2016 – Google’s AlphaGo defeated Go champion Lee Sedol, a major milestone.</p>

AI became part of daily life: Siri, Alexa, self-driving cars, recommendation systems.

<h2> 2020s–Now: Generative AI and Future Directions</h2>
<p>Rise of Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL·E, Sora).
AI is used in medicine, art, education, business, and entertainment.
Ongoing debates around ethics, job automation, AI safety, and regulation.</P>
