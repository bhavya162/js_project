    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence, commonly known as AI, is a branch of computer
      science that aims to create machines that can simulate human intelligence.
      This includes the ability to learn, reason, solve problems, understand
      language, and even perceive the environment. AI systems are designed to
      perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as
      recognizing speech, making decisions, translating languages, or playing
      games.

    <h3>WHAT IS AI?</h3>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence, commonly known as AI, is a branch of computer
      science that aims to create machines that can simulate human intelligence.
      This includes the ability to learn, reason, solve problems, understand
      language, and even perceive the environment. AI systems are designed to
      perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as
      recognizing speech, making decisions, translating languages, or playing
      games. The concept of AI has existed for decades, but recent advancements
      in computing power, data availability, and machine learning algorithms
      have accelerated its development. Today, AI is embedded in everyday
      tools—from smartphones and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, to
      self-driving cars, medical diagnosis systems, and recommendation engines
      on platforms like YouTube or Netflix.
     Narrow AI – focused on specific tasks (e.g., spam filters, facial recognition).
      General AI – aims to replicate human-level intelligence across various tasks.
      Superintelligent AI – a theoretical concept where machines surpass human intelligence.

    <h3>TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Supervised Learning-
            Learns from labeled data (input with correct output).Goal: Predict outcomes for new data.Examples: Spam detection, disease prediction.
            Common Algorithms: Linear regression, decision trees, neural networks.</li>
      <li> Unsupervised Learning- Learns from unlabeled data (no output provided).Goal: Discover hidden patterns or groupings.
          Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.</li>
