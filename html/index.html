   <br> </h2> Let's Learn about AI </h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that enables machines to perform tasks that usually require human 
    intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving,
     and understanding language. AI is used in technologies like voice assistants, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems.
     It helps automate processes, improve accuracy, and make smart decisions.</P>
