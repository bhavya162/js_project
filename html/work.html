    <h1>HOW DOES AI WORK</h1>

    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) works by mimicking how humans think, learn,
      and make decisions. At its core, AI systems use large amounts of data,
      identify patterns, and make predictions or take actions based on that
      data. The process often begins with data collection, which could include
      anything from images and text to numbers and sensor inputs. This data is
      then processed using algorithms—step-by-step instructions or mathematical
      models—that help the machine learn from it. In supervised learning, for
      example, the system is trained on labeled data (where the correct answer
      is already known), allowing it to learn the relationship between input and
      output. In unsupervised learning, the AI tries to find hidden patterns
      without specific guidance. Reinforcement learning allows AI to learn
      through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on its
      actions. Over time, the AI improves its performance by adjusting its
      internal parameters to reduce errors. The more data and experience it
      gets, the better it becomes at making accurate predictions or decisions,
      which is how modern AI powers technologies like voice assistants,
      recommendation systems, self-driving cars, and more.
